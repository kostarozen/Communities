In this toy project I analyse populations of different religious communities in Israel over time, in order to show which communities increase their percentage over time, and how their growth rates differ.

I'm using 2 publicly available datasets about Israel population and sizes over different religious communities over time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Israel#Births_and_deaths https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Israel#Relative_sizes_of_the_religious_communities_in_Israel

Both datasets are part of the repository as excel files.
